# ML Collections
The purpose of this repository is get my hands dirty on Machine Learning/Deep Learning with various existing projects, and see I can come up with some ideas! It has mainly 3 parts.

* Tensorflows - Tensorflow tutorials and models, dataset and etc. 
* Docs - how to create and/or train model with Tensorflows including interesting papers
* Exmaple - applied trained model with end user platform using MLKit/CoreML etc. It will contain example projects and step by step tutorials

I will use following frameworks to implement a concept in Mobile platform
* CoreML 
* MLKit 
* Fritz
